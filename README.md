# Meeting-with-teammates
I recently conducted a meeting with my teammates to address an issue on Figma, a collaborative design tool. Additionally, I had a productive introductory call with our new team members. During the call, we had the opportunity to introduce ourselves and become familiar with each other's roles and responsibilities.
